# Dataset Class Equalizer

Welcome to the Dataset Class Equalizer repository, developed by the ISL Intelligent Systems Lab. This tool is designed to help balance class distributions in datasets, which is particularly useful for enhancing the performance of machine learning models affected by class imbalance.

## Features

- **Class Distribution Analysis**: Provides tools to analyze the distribution of classes within your dataset.
- **Equalization Process**: Automates adjustments to datasets to achieve balanced class distributions.
- **Customization**: Offers configurable parameters to tailor the process to specific needs.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

To set up the Dataset Class Equalizer on your system, start by cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ISL-INTELLIGENT-SYSTEMS-LAB/Dataset_Class_Equalizer.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed. Then install the required libraries using:
